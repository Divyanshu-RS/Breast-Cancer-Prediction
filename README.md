# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for training and testing the models is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, along with additional data from government health datasets, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting breast cancer. The algorithms used in this project include:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. This dataset contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
